# Cryptography Project
## Text Encryption/Decryption Tool
A simple Python-based encryption and decryption tool that converts text into encrypted ciphertext and back again.

### Overview
This project implements a basic cryptographic system following the process:

text
Text ‚Üí Encrypt ‚Üí Cipher Text ‚Üí Decrypt ‚Üí Text
### Current Status - Day 1
‚úÖ Implemented initial encryption logic

üîÑ Working on fixing some bugs in the implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è Basic functionality is working but needs refinement

### Features
Text encryption using XOR operations with cryptographic keys

Hexadecimal and binary output formats

Unique key generation for each character

Simple command-line interface

### Project Structure

-- message.py     
-- README.md      

### Technical Details
The encryption process:

Generates unique 16-byte cryptographic keys for each character

Uses the XOR operation with the last byte of each key for encryption

Outputs results in both hexadecimal and binary formats

Maintains a mapping dictionary for potential decryption
