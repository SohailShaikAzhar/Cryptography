# Cryptography Project
Text Encryption/Decryption Tool
A Python-based encryption and decryption tool that converts text into encrypted binary ciphertext and back again using a custom cryptographic algorithm.

## Overview
This project implements a custom cryptographic system with the following process:

Plain Text â†’ Encrypt â†’ Binary Cipher Text â†’ Decrypt â†’ Plain Text
## ðŸ“‹ Project Status
### Day 1 - Foundation
âœ… Initial Encryption Logic - Basic encryption implementation.

âœ… Initial Structure - Core framework established (with some bugs and incomplete features).

### Day 2 - Core Implementation
âœ… Complete Encryption System - Fully functional encryption module.

âœ… Complete Decryption System - Fully functional decryption module.

âœ… Cryptographic Security - Uses cryptographically secure random number generation (CSPRNG).

âœ… Key Management - Proper key generation, handling, and storage mechanisms.

âœ… Binary Encoding - Fixed binary encoding/decoding issues for reliable data processing.

âœ… Standalone Modules - Separate, well-organized files for encryption and decryption.

### Day 3 - Security Enhancements
âœ… Zero-Prefix Prevention - Implemented protection against zero-byte prefixes in generated values.

âœ… Robust Key Validation - Added while-loop validation to ensure generated keys never start with zero.

âœ… Byte-Level Security - Direct byte manipulation for efficient zero-byte detection.

âœ… Deterministic Output - Guaranteed non-zero starting bytes for all cryptographic values.


## Features
Text encryption using dual-phase key encryption

Binary output format for ciphertext

Unique key generation for each character

Cryptographically secure random number generation

Simple command-line interface

Standalone encryption and decryption modules

## Technical Details
The encryption process:

Generates a 16-byte cryptographic master key

Splits the key into two halves for dual-phase encryption

Creates unique 4-byte keys for each character

Maps characters to their ASCII values with unique keys

Applies dual-phase encryption using split key halves

Converts results to binary format

The decryption process:

Recovers binary chunks from the ciphertext

Splits the master key into two halves

Reverses the encryption process

Extracts original character values

Reconstructs the original message
